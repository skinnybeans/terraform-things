# TERRAFORM THINGS

A collections of things I've been using to learn terraform.

Some it it is useful, some of it is not!

## The useful bits

### ECS Module

Take a look at the module [ecs-fargate module](modules/services/ecs-fargate-web) for a reasonable implementation of getting a task running on fargate.

Useage of the module can be found here [ecs-fargate deployment](stage/services/ecs-fargate)
